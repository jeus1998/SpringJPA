# 페이징 API

- `JPA`는 페이징을 다음 두 `API`로 추상화
- `setFirstResult(int startPosition)`: 조회 시작 위치(0부터 시작)
- `setMaxResults(int maxResult)`: 조회할 데이터 수

### 페이징 API 예시

```java
for(int i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
    Member member = new Member();
    member.setUsername("member" + i);
    member.setAge(i);
    em.persist(member);
}
em.flush();
em.clear();

List<Member> resultList = em.createQuery("select m from Member m order by m.age asc", Member.class)
        .setFirstResult(0)
        .setMaxResults(10)
        .getResultList();

System.out.println("resultList.size() = " + resultList.size());
for (Member member : resultList) {
    System.out.println("member = " + member);
}
```

실행 결과
```text
resultList.size() = 10
member = Member{id=1, username='member1', age=1}
member = Member{id=2, username='member2', age=2}
member = Member{id=3, username='member3', age=3}
member = Member{id=4, username='member4', age=4}
member = Member{id=5, username='member5', age=5}
member = Member{id=6, username='member6', age=6}
member = Member{id=7, username='member7', age=7}
member = Member{id=8, username='member8', age=8}
member = Member{id=9, username='member9', age=9}
member = Member{id=10, username='member10', age=10}
```
- setMaxResults(10)으로 설정해서 10개가 나오고 있다. 
- setFirstResult(0): 0부터 시작(제일 첫번째 데이터부터 나온다)

### 페이징 API - MySQL 방언  
```text
SELECT
     M.ID AS ID,
     M.AGE AS AGE,
     M.TEAM_ID AS TEAM_ID,
     M.NAME AS NAME 
FROM
    MEMBER M 
ORDER BY
    M.NAME DESC LIMIT ?, ?
```

### 페이징 API - Oracle 방언

```text
SELECT * FROM
     ( SELECT ROW_.*, ROWNUM ROWNUM_ 
     FROM
         ( SELECT
             M.ID AS ID,
             M.AGE AS AGE,
             M.TEAM_ID AS TEAM_ID,
             M.NAME AS NAME 
         FROM MEMBER M 
         ORDER BY M.NAME 
         ) ROW_ 
     WHERE ROWNUM <= ?
     ) 
WHERE ROWNUM_ > ?
```
